     2-sided marketplace for parking space </h2>
    <img src="images/page2_park.png" alt = "park project">
    <p>PARK is a platform (mobile application) that matches between supply and demand. The application will automatically match drivers with individually-owned parking spots in a safe, convenient, seamless way using a mobile application. PARK leverages the sharing economy to create a two-sided marketplace for parking (similar to Uber and Airbnb but for parking space). PARK’s core functionality is using complex algorithms to match drivers who are looking for parking with the best available spot that meets their criteria.</p>

  <h2>Product Strategy<br>
     Usecase development & GTM Strategy For Cortana Digital Assistant</h2>
    <img src="images/page2_cortana.jpeg" alt = "cortana project">
    <p>Despite this precipitous level of growth that is projected to continue, skills and usage of digital assistants (DAs) on smart speakers, phones, and PCs are still developing. To illustrate, top task requests include playing music, getting the weather, getting the news, and checking the time. Microsoft has recognized that there is still a lot of room for a digital assistant with more advanced capabilities that can help save consumers time and boost their productivity by completing more complex tasks. In addition, no personal assistant has been able to truly master productivity in the workplace or cut across users' personal and professional lives. Therefore, the project was recommending how its artificial intelligence digital assistant team (Cortana) could bridge the gap for users between their work and home lives.

  <h2>User Research and Product Development<br>
     URe-Innovate Online Banking Application</h2>
    <img src="images/page2_bank.png" alt = "banking project">
    <p>Our client was the top-3 Thai bank in Thailand. The client had a comparably low presence in online banking because the application was difficult to use and not user friendly. Our team came in to redesign the new online banking to improve usability and incorporate new features that improve users’ experience in online banking and help users manage their personal finances better.
